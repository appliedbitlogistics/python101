# Lesson 0: [Introduction & Setup](Lessons/00_Setup/lesson.md)

Before we jump into learning Python we need some skills and tools to help us.  We'll need to install **Python**, a **Code Editor**, a command line **terminal** shell, and **Git** at a minimum.  

**Objectives**:
- Setting up the Python environment (Windows/Linux).
- Using interactive shells and basic Python IDEs ([VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), [Microsoft Virtual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code),  PyCharm).


## Installing Python

To run Python programs you'll need to install Python on your computer.

> There are notable differences in older Python versions. To keep things simple we'll be using Python 3.x.

### Windows
- https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

### Linux

Debian/Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install python3
```

## Installing a Code Editor

### [Microsoft Virtual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS 
Code)
VS Code is a very popular free mainstream code editor will full support for your coding needs.
- Download: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

### [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) 
The free open source version of VS Code which [does not track your data](https://vscodium.com/#why).  This offer the same capablities as VS Code but with out sending you data back to Microsoft.

## Git
Git is a code revision tool, and while becomming proficient with Git has a modest learning curve, we can get started with it without too much distraction.  Initially Git will server as a back system to help keep us from accidentally loosing our work.  But as we continue to advance our programming skills we will find Git is an invaluable tool that we wonder how we ever lived without.
