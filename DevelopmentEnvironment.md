# Python Development Environment
I'm starting this project in Oct 2024 to learn Python.  My development environment will be in Linux (Debian / Zorin), however I'll also be co-learning with someone on Windows and will include the same environment on both Operating systems.

Before we start coding we need a few tools to make things easier in the long run.

# Code Editor
We'll need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or specialized software to edit our code files. Technically we can use Notepad, or even MS word.  But it is much easier to edit code in a code editor.  There are many choices to select from but we'll off 2 options:

## [Microsoft Virtual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code)
VS Code is a very popular free mainstream code editor will full support for your coding needs.
- Download: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

## [Codium](https://vscodium.com/) 
The free open source version of VS Code which [does not track your data](https://vscodium.com/#why).  This offer the same capablities as VS Code but with out sending you data back to Microsoft.

  - Debian Linux: https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases/download/1.93.1.24256/codium_1.93.1.24256_amd64.deb

# Code Revision
While it has a bit of a learning curve, using a code revision tool to track changes in your code is an invaluable tool, and well worth the time to become famliar with before you start coding.  While there are many code revision options, Git is by far the mainstream tool to use in modern programming.

## Git

#### Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win
  - Download: https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.46.1.windows.1/Git-2.46.1-64-bit.exe

#### Debian Linux
```
sudo apt install git
```

# Github
https://github.com is a website for collabortive coding.  It is a convenient place to share code
